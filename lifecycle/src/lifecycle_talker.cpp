 * Every lifecycle node has a set of services attached to it
 * which make it controllable from the outside and invoke state
 * changes.
 * Available Services as for Beta1:
 * - <node_name>__get_state
 * - <node_name>__change_state
 * - <node_name>__get_available_states
 * - <node_name>__get_available_transitions
 * Additionally, a publisher for state change notifications is
 * created:
 * - <node_name>__transition_event
