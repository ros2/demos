## Image Tools Demo in Python

This is a demonstration of the Quality of Service (QoS) features of ROS 2 using
Python.
There are two programs implemented here: cam2image_py, and showimage_py.

### CAM2IMAGE_PY
This is a Python program that will take data from an attached camera, and
publish the data to a topic called "image", with the type
`sensor_msgs/msg/Image`.
If a camera isn't available, this program can also generate a default image and
smoothly "move" it across the screen, simulating motion.  The usage output from
the program looks like this:

```
usage: cam2image_py [-h] [-b] [-d DEPTH] [-f FREQUENCY] [-k {0,1}] [-r {0,1}]
                    [-s {0,1}] [-t TOPIC] [-x WIDTH] [-y HEIGHT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b, --burger          Produce images of burgers rather than connecting to a
                        camera (default: False)
  -d DEPTH, --depth DEPTH
                        Queue depth (default: 10)
  -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                        Publish frequency in Hz (default: 30)
  -k {0,1}, --keep {0,1}
                        History QoS setting, 0 - keep last sample, 1 - keep
                        all the samples (default: 1)
  -r {0,1}, --reliability {0,1}
                        Reliability QoS setting, 0 - best effort, 1 - reliable
                        (default: 1)
  -t TOPIC, --topic TOPIC
                        Topic to publish on (default: image)

  -s {0,1}, --show {0,1}
                        Show the camera stream (default: 0)
  -x WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                        Image width (default: 320)
  -y HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT
                        Image height (default: 240)
```

The `-d`, `-k`, and `-r` parameters control various aspects of the QoS
implementation, and are the most interesting to play with when testing out QoS.

Note that this program also subscribes to a topic called "flip_image" of type
`std_msgs/msg/Bool`.
If "flip_image" is set to `False`, the data coming out of the camera is sent as
usual.
If "flip_image" is set to `True`, the data coming out of the camera is flipped
around the Y axis.

If the `-s` parameter is set to 1, then this program opens up a (local) window
to show the images that are being published.
However, these images are *not* coming in through the ROS 2 pub/sub model, so
this window cannot show off the QoS parameters (it is mostly useful for
debugging).
See SHOWIMAGE_PY below for a program that can show QoS over the pub/sub model.

### SHOWIMAGE_PY
This is a Python program that subscribes to the "image" topic, waiting for data.
As new data comes in, this program accepts the data and can optionally render
it to the screen.
The usage output from the program looks like this:

```
usage: showimage_py [-h] [-d QUEUE_DEPTH] [-k {0,1}] [-r {0,1}] [-s {0,1}]
                    [-t TOPIC]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d QUEUE_DEPTH, --depth QUEUE_DEPTH
                        Queue depth (default: 10)
  -k {0,1}, --keep {0,1}
                        History QoS setting, 0 - keep last sample, 1 - keep
                        all the samples (default: 1)
  -r {0,1}, --reliability {0,1}
                        Reliability QoS setting, 0 - best effort, 1 - reliable
                        (default: 1)
  -s {0,1}, --show {0,1}
                        Show the camera stream (default: 1)
  -t TOPIC, --topic TOPIC
                        use topic TOPIC instead of the default (default: image)
```

The `-d`, `-k`, and `-r` parameters control various aspects of the QoS
implementation, and are the most interesting to play with when testing out QoS.

If the `-s` parameter is set to 1, then this program opens up a window to show
the images that have been received over the ROS 2 pub/sub model.
This program should be used in conjunction with cam2image_py to demonstrate the
ROS 2 QoS capabilities over lossy/slow links.

### EXAMPLE USAGE
To use the above programs, you would run them something like the following:

In the first terminal, run the data publisher.
This will connect to the first camera available, and print out
"Publishing image #" for each image it publishes.
```
$ ros2 run image_tools_py cam2image_py
```

If you don't have a local camera, you can use the `-b` parameter to generate
data on the fly rather than get data from a camera:
```
$ ros2 run image_tools_py cam2image_py -b
```

In a second terminal, run the data subscriber.
This will subscribe to the "image" topic and render any frames it receives.
```
$ ros2 run image_tools_py showimage_py
```
