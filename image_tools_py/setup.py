# This configuration deserves some explanation.  The goal is to generate a
# test file called something like 'test_showimage_cam2image__rmw_fastrtps_.py'
# that contains the test from test_showimage_cam2image.py.in, customized
# for the rmw_implementation we want to test and for absolute paths of this
# installation.  To do that, we override the 'install_scripts' stage of
# setuptools, since that is the stage that knows the paths to the 'cam2image_py'
# and 'showimage_py' executables.
#
# TODO(clalancette): One downside to what is being done below is that the output
# file is being left in the source directory.  That's currently necessary
# because the pytest invocation only looks there for test scripts.  It would
# be nicer to generate the output file in the 'build' directory and then point
# pytest at it, but I don't know how to do that.
