## **What Is This?**

This is a simple demo robot with all components from publishing **joint states** to publishing **fake laser data** until visualizing the robot model on a map in `RViz2`.

## **Build**

```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir -p demo_ws/src
cd ~/demo_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros2/demos.git

cd ~/demo_ws
source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash
colcon build --package-select dummy_map_server dummy_sensors dummy_robot_bringup
```

## **Run**

```bash
cd ~/demo_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch dummy_robot_bringup dummy_robot_bringup.launch.py
```

## **Verify**

A similar terminal output should be seen:

```bash

The robot should be displayed similarly in `RViz2`:

## **FAQ**

`Q`: I ran `ros2 launch dummy_robot_bringup dummy_robot_bringup.launch.py` and `rviz2`. However, nothing is displayed in `RViz2` window.

`A`: This issue could be related to the **ROS2 Daemon**. It serves the same role as a **ROS1 Master** but within **ROS2**. Restarting the daemon, as follows, should resolve this issue.

`Reference`: https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/582#issuecomment-775997721

``` bash
ros2 daemon stop; ros2 daemon start
# Verify
# Open new terminal
ros2 launch dummy_robot_bringup dummy_robot_bringup.launch.py
# Open new terminal
ros2 node list 
```

```bash
# You should see the following terminal output:
/dummy_joint_states
/dummy_laser
/dummy_map_server
/robot_state_publisher
```
