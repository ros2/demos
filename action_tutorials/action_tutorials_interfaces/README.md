# Action Tutorials ROS2 Interface

Defines the Fibonacci action for use with the action tutorials. 

Goal contains an *order* field which determines the length of the returned Fibonacci sequence. For example, order 2 should return sequence [0, 1] and order 5 should return sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].

Feedback consists of a partial sequence that is returned as the Fibonacci sequence is calculated. For example, for order 5 at some point the partial sequence [0, 1, 1] will be returned.

Result consists of the complete Fibonacci sequence.
